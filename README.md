# "Getting a Clearer Picture of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro"
This repository has all Python and R code used to perform the analysis and generate the figures used in my Medium article about COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro, "Getting a Clearer Picture of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro". It consists of an analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 situation in Rio using a Seasonal Kinetic Model, a mixture of the models used in [1] and [2]. 

To run all code properly, first make sure everything's in the same directory. Then run the R script, changing the file path if necessary, then run the Python scripts. The following packages and libraries are required in order to run all scripts:
### Python Libraries
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * lmfit
  * SciPy
### R Libraries
  * readxl
